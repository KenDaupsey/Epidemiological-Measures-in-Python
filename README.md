# Epidemiological-Measures-in-Python

Introduction
This project aims to provide a practical implementation and understanding of various epidemiological measures used in disease analysis and public health decision-making. These measures quantify the relationship between exposures and health outcomes, enabling researchers and healthcare professionals to assess risk factors, evaluate interventions, and develop targeted prevention strategies.

Measures Covered
The project covers the following epidemiological measures:

Odds Ratio: Quantifies the relationship between an exposure and an outcome, typically used in case-control studies.
Relative Risk: Compares the likelihood of an outcome occurring between an exposed cohort and an unexposed cohort in a prospective analysis.
Attributable Risk: Quantifies the degree to which a particular exposure contributes to an outcome within a population.
Population Attributable Risk (PAR): Represents the fraction of current cases that could be averted if a risk factor were hypothetically eliminated.
Prevalence: Quantifies the proportion of a population exhibiting a disease at a given point in time.
Incidence Rate: Captures emerging condition occurrences by tallying only new cases and dividing by the total population follow-up time.
Setup
To run this project, you will need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the following Python libraries are required:

pandas
numpy
You can install these libraries using pip:


Copy code
pip install pandas numpy
Usage
Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Open the Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing the code.
Follow the instructions and examples provided to calculate and interpret the epidemiological measures.
Modify the sample data or provide your own dataset to explore different scenarios.
Examples
The project includes code examples for each epidemiological measure, demonstrating how to calculate and interpret the results using sample data. The examples are accompanied by detailed explanations and interpretations to aid in understanding the practical applications of these measures.
